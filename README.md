# Plant Valve Manager

This is a simulator of an administrator program that might be seen at a chemical plant.

Within this software, company administrators may create accounts whereby they can create an inventory of their organization's stock of valves; including each valve's condition, age, technical specifications and measurements, and much more. Alongside this feature is the ability to browse and purchase from a central marketplace filled with listings created by the producers of chemical plant valve that will contain up-to-date information and save time by allowing administrators to connect directly with producers instead of going through third parties and paying higher ordering fees.
